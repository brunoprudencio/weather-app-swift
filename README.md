# weather-app-swift

App built following the https://designcode.io tutorial.

The app is under development, which I intend to implement my own features ideas, like:

  - [ ] Add more than one city to retrieve weather data
  - [ ] Horizontal scroll, (similar like Instagram APP stories) to navigate through the cities you marked as favorite
  - [ ] Real city images
  - [ ] Dynamic color and image changing accordingly to the weather

App running on MacOS:
