# weather-app-swift

App built following the https://designcode.io tutorial.

The app is under development, which I intend to implement more features like:

  -[] Add more than one city to retrieve weather data
  -[] Horizontal scroll, (similar like Instagram APP stories) to navigate through the cities you marked as favorite
  -[] Real city images
  -[] Dynamic color and image changing accordingly to the weather
